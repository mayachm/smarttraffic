# SmartTraffic RL Project

This project trains and tests a traffic-light RL agent using SUMO.
In regions like the UAE, where rapid urban growth and heavy peak-hour congestion strain intersections, this project simulates a scalable RL-based solution across 16 junctions to explore how smarter signal control could ease traffic flow and improve mobility in dense city environments.
**Check testing examples to see how it works **
## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- SUMO 1.24+ installed and added to PATH
- Packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Setup

```bash
# Create environment
conda create -n smarttraffic python=3.9
conda activate smarttraffic

# Install packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
